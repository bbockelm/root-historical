<li>Automatic support for multiple <tt>TTreeCache</tt> per <tt>TFile</tt>.<p/>
Multiple <tt>TTreeCache</tt> per <tt>TFile</tt> for reading are supporrted by using the existing <tt>TTree::SetCacheSize(Long64_t)</tt> interface.<p/>
In addition, a <tt>TTreeCache</tt> for a <tt>TTree</tt> can be added using <tt>TFile::SetCacheRead(TFileCacheRead*, TObject*)</tt>, where the second (optional) argument is a pointer to the <tt>TTree</tt>. The cache can be removed by setting the pointer to 0.  In that case the user will have to take ownership for the cache.<p/>
Similarily, a pointer to the <tt>TTreeCache</tt> for a <tt>TTree</tt> can be obtained using <tt>TFile::GetCacheRead(TObject*)</tt>.
