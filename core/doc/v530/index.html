<h3>Core</h3>

<h4>TString</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Reimplementation of the internals of TString to not use reference counting and
copy on write, but to use a more modern and thread safe Short String
Optimization (SSO) technique. Using SSO short strings (&lt;15 on 64-bit and
&lt;11 on 32-bit) are contained in the  TString internal data structure
without the need for mallocing the required space.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TObject</h4>
<ul>
<li>
In <tt>TObject::ls</tt>, add support for the option 'noaddr' which 
prevents the printing of the address of the object.   This
is useful in particular in roottest.   Use this in <tt>hadd</tt>
and <tt>TFileMerger</tt>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TROOT</h4>
<ul>
<li>New routine <tt>CloseFiles</tt> used automatically shortly before termination to 
insure closing of files and sockets before the unload of any library.</li>
<li>New collection '<tt>ClosedObjects</tt>' holding pointers to <tt>TFile</tt> or <tt>TSocket</tt> that
have been closed but not deleted it.  In the case of <tt>TSocket</tt>, they are added only
if they are closed by the <tt>CloseFiles</tt>.</li>
<li>Add a Close member function to <tt>TProofMgr</tt> since it is added to the list of socket.</li>
<li>Migrate the closing of files from various to a single place (<tt>T*System::Exit</tt>).</li>
<li>Fill in the implementation of <tt>TROOT::FindObjectAnyFile</tt>.</li>
<li>Mark TROOT as <tt>TObject::kInvalidObject</tt> as soon as its destructor starts,
in order to be able to veto some action later on (like autoloading).</li>
</ul>

<h4>TSystem</h4>
<ul>
<li>Better handle the cases where the information in the rootmap file is (almost) empty.   
Avoid infinite loop if one of the dependent library is missing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Meta</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improve error message in case a schema evolution rule can not be loaded when the library is loaded
(from the generic 'it conflicts with one of the other rules' to 'the target member ... is unknown'.</li>
</ul>

<h4>TFolder</h4>
<ul>
<li>Several enhancement and clarification to <tt>TFolder::FindFullPathName</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>TStyle</h4>
<ul>
<li> Add the fill color attribute (<tt>SetLegendFillColor()</tt> and the font
     attribute (<tt>SetLegendFont()</tt>.
</li>
<li> A new <tt>TStyle</tt> called "Modern" has been implemented. It can be set with:
     <pre>
     gROOT->SetStyle("Modern");
     </pre>
     It has very little decoration. It was made looking at the default styles
     usually used by the experiments.
     <br>
     A new parameter <tt>Canvas.Style</tt> in <tt>config/rootrc.in</tt> allows
     to define the default style. If it is not specified, the <tt>Modern</tt>
     style is used. To use the old default style on can set it to <tt>Classic</tt>.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>ACLiC</h4>
<ul>
<li> ACLiC now passes the macro <tt>__ACLIC__</tt> to both the rootcint and compiler phases.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TWinNTSystem</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix 64-bit compatibility issues (__asm keyword is not allowed)</li>
<li>Try (as much as possible) to avoid the disturbing "There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into drive \Device\..." popup message box when calling AccessPathName() on removable disk drives with no media installed. This should fix the problem reported <a href="http://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=11704">on the forum</a></li>
<li> Prevent short timers (e.g. 10ms) to keep looping in the DispatchOneEvent() infinite loop</li>
<li> Better stdout/stderr redirection (it was impossible to restore stdout using freopen on Windows 7, leaving the console as a zombie...)</li>
<li> Make sure the stdout/stderr redirection works also in the case there is no console (i.e. in stand-alone applications)</li>
<li> Make sure the file descriptors are valid before using them
</ul>
