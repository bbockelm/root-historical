<h3>Core</h3>

<h4>TString</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Reimplementation of the internals of TString to not use reference counting and
copy on write, but to use a more modern and thread safe Short String
Optimization (SSO) technique. Using SSO short strings (&lt;15 on 64-bit and
&lt;11 on 32-bit) are contained in the  TString internal data structure
without the need for mallocing the required space.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TStyle</h4>
<ul>
<li> Add the fill color attribute (<tt>SetLegendFillColor()</tt> and the font
     attribute (<tt>SetLegendFont()</tt>.
</li>
<li> A new TStyle called "Modern" has been implemented. It can be set with:
     <pre>
     gROOT->SetStyle("Modern");
     </pre>
     It has very little decoration. It was made looking at the default styles
     usually used by the experiments.
     <br>
     A new parameter <tt>Canvas.Style</tt> in <tt>config/rootrc.in</tt> allows
     to define the default style. If it is not specified, the <tt>Modern</tt>
     style is used. To use the old default style on can set it to <tt>Classic</tt>.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>ACLiC</h4>
<ul>
<li> ACLiC now passes the macro __ACLIC__ to both the rootcint and compiler phases.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TWinNTSystem</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix 64-bit compatibility issues (__asm keyword is not allowed)</li>
<li>Try (as much as possible) to avoid the disturbing "There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into drive \Device\..." popup message box when calling AccessPathName() on removable disk drives with no media installed. This should fix the problem reported <a href="http://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=11704">on the forum</a></li>
<li> Prevent short timers (e.g. 10ms) to keep looping in the DispatchOneEvent() infinite loop</li>
<li> Better stdout/stderr redirection (it was impossible to restore stdout using freopen on Windows 7, leaving the console as a zombie...)</li>
<li> Make sure the stdout/stderr redirection works also in the case there is no console (i.e. in stand-alone applications)</li>
<li> Make sure the file descriptors are valid before using them
</ul>
