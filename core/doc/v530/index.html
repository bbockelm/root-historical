<h3>TStyle</h3>
<ul>
<li> Add the fill color attribute (<tt>SetLegendFillColor()</tt> and the font
     attribute (<tt>SetLegendFont()<tt>.
</li>
<li> A new TStyle called "Clean" has been implemented. It can be set with:
     <pre>
     gROOT->SetStyle("Clean");
     </pre>
     It has very little decoration. It was made looking at the default styles
     usually used by the experiments.
</li>
</ul>
