<h4>rootcling</h4>

rootcling is the successor to rootcint and genreflex.   It is used to implement backward compatibility wrapper for both of them with the following backward incompatibilities.

rootcling does not support multiline #pragma without a line continuation as rootcint did (rootcint support #pragma link with a line continutation only in ROOT v5.34/02 and above).
