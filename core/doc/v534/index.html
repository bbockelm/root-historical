<h4>ROOT Error Handlers</h4>
<p>There is a new rootrc variable which allows to control the
installation of the ROOT error handlers. By default the handlers
are activated:</p>
<pre> 
   Root.ErrorHandlers:      1
</pre>
<p>but setting the value to 0 result in no error handlers being installed
and the originals remaining in place. This can be useful if ROOT is used in
conjunction with other frameworks that already installed their own handlers.
