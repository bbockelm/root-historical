<h4>TClonesArray</h4>

<ul>
<li>Introduce <tt>TClonesArray::ConstructedAt</tt> which
always returns an already constructed object.   If the slot is being used for the
first time, it calls the default constructor otherwise it returns the object as 
is (unless a string is passed as the 2nd argument to the function in which case,
it also calls Clear(second_argument) on the object).
This allows to replace code like:
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">   for (int i = 0; i < ev->Ntracks; i++) {
       new(a[i]) TTrack(x,y,z,...);
       ...
       ...
   }
   ...
   a.Delete(); // or a.Clear("C")
</pre>
with the simpler and more efficient:
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">   for (int i = 0; i < ev->Ntracks; i++) {   
       TTrack *track = (TTrack*)a.ConstructedAt(i);
       track->Set(x,y,z,....);
       ...                                                          
       ...                                                          
   }                                                               
   ...                                                             
   a.Clear();
</pre>
even in case where the TTrack class allocates memory.
</li>
<li>TClonesArray: update ExpandCreateFast to also reset the non-used slots
so that calling Clear (which does too much) is no longer necessary
when using ExpandCreateFast.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>New Thread Pool class</h4>
<ul>
<li>
A first version of TThreadPool class has been introduced.
This class implements <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool_pattern">a Thread Pool pattern</a>.
So far it supports only one type of queue - FIFO.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Thread library</h4>

<ul>
<li>Reduces risk of internal dead lock by using a private internal lock to protect the internals of TThread, rather than using TThread::Lock
</li>
<li>New header TThreadSlots.h to centralize and formalize the use of the TThread local memory slots amongst the ROOT packages.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Global Variables</h4>
<ul>
<li>The global values gPad, gVirtualX, gInterpreter, gDirectory and gFile
are now all accessed via a static function of their respective class.  The 
access is made transparent via a CPP macro.</li>
<li>The access is now also made transparent from the CINT and python prompt.</li>
<li>gPad, gVirtualX and gInterpreter are now accessible even when their value 
is zero and they now properly support tab completion.</li>
<li>See the important note in the I/O section on gDirectory and gFile which 
are now thread local.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Meta</h4>
<ul>
<li>The new interface <tt>TDictionary::GetDictionary(const char*)</tt> offers a
single entry point to query the type based on its name, conveniently combining
TDataType and TClass queries. It does name normalization (removing std etc).
</li>
<li>Add the ability to explicitly forbid (or allow) the splitting of a class
(<tt>TClass::SetSplit</tt>) so that user can inforce the use of a custom streamer in all possible split cases.
</li>
<li>Resolve several issues with the creation of StreamerInfo for abstract classes.
</li>

<li>When looking for the value corresponding to an enum type, skip global that are not enums. (This improves the speed of TFile::Open by 60%).
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TStyle</h4>
<ul>
<li>
The Modern style has now a transparent background for the histogram title.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Misc.</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the root executable, auto-detect command line arguments that are local root files even if their name does not end with ".root"
</li>
<li>If home directory is not correctly set in pw file or user is not known, use the HOME shell variable to find the desired home directory.
</li>
</ul>
