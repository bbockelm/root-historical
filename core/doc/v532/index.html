<h4>New Thread Pool class</h4>
<ul>
<li>
A first version of TThreadPool class has been introduced.
This class implements <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool_pattern">a Thread Pool pattern</a>.
So far it supports only one type of queue - FIFO.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Global Variables</h4>
<ul>
<li>The global values gPad, gVirtualX, gInterpreter, gDirectory and gFile
are now all accessed via a static function of their respective class.  The 
access is made transparent via a CPP macro.</li>
<li>The access is now also made transparent from the CINT and python prompt.</li>
<li>gPad, gVirtualX and gInterpreter are now accessible even when their value 
is zero and they now properly support tab completion.</li>
<li>See the important note in the I/O section on gDirectory and gFile which 
are now thread local.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Dictionaries</h4>
<ul>
<li>The new interface <tt>TDictionary::GetDictionary(const char*)</tt> offers a
single entry point to query the type based on its name, conveniently combining
TDataType and TClass queries. It does name normalization (removing std etc).
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TStyle</h4>
<ul>
<li>
The Modern style has now a transparent background for the histogram title.
</li>
</ul>
