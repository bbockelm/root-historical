<h3>Histogram Libraries</h3>

<h3>THn, THnBase, THNSparse</h3>
<ul>
<li>The new, non-sparse n-dimensional histogram <tt>THn</tt> has been introduced.
It follows the same interfaces as <tt>THnSparse</tt>, and thus also implements <tt>THnF THnD THnC THnS THnI THnL</tt>.<br/>
<b>NOTE</b>: the memory usage of this class increases with the number of bins, i.e. <em>exponentially</em> with the number of dimensions!
A 5-dimensional <tt>THnD</tt> with 100 bins per dimension uses more than 80GB of RAM!
Better use <tt>THnSparse</tt> if only a small fraction of the bins are filled.</li>
<li>Most algorithms are now implemented in <tt>THnBase</tt>, the new common base class of <tt>THnSparse</tt> and <tt>THn</tt>.
If a function does not care about the actual storage format on in incoming objects it might as well reference a <tt>THnBase</tt>.</li>
<li>The bins of <tt>THn</tt> are held by objects of the new type <tt>TNDArray</tt>: an n-dimensional array with lazy allocation (only when a bin is set) that implements an <tt>operator []</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>THn</tt> and <tt>THnSparse</tt> can be created from histograms and from each other, allowing for easy conversion. There is currently no support for drawing a <tt>THnBase</tt>-derived object; project it into a <tt>TH1/2/3</tt> first.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h3>THistPainter</h3>
<ul>
<li>
When 1D histograms are painted with the options TEXT and BAR simultaneously, the text for
each bin is placed taking into account the bar offset and bar width attributes. Previously,
when several histogram were drawn that way, the texts overlapped.
</li>
<li>
When a </tt>TF1</tt> was clipped vertically, horizotal lines appeared at the maximum and minimum
when the function was draw with a line width greater than 1.
The follwoing macro reproduces the problem:
<pre>
{ 
   TCanvas *c1=new TCanvas("c1", "A canvas", 10,0, 800, 600); 
   c1->SetLogy(); 
   histo_dummy=c1->DrawFrame(0,1e-4,27,10); 
   TF1 gaussian_func("gaussian_func","gaus",0,25.4); 
   gaussian_func.SetLineColor(kRed); 
   gaussian_func.SetParameters(1e-2,10,3); 
   gaussian_func.Draw("same"); 
}
</pre>
</li>
<li>
When two histograms where painted on top of each other with the option BOX (the
2nd one with BOX,SAME) the plot was wrong if the minimum of the first histogram
was not zero.
</li>
<li>
Take into account the absolute value of the histogram's minimum to compute the 
maximal boxes' size when an histogram is drawn with the option BOX.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>TH1</h3>
<ul>
<li>
A canvas saved in a <tt>.C</tt> file generated wrong code if it contained
an histogram drawn with the option <tt>COLZ</tt>.
</li>
</ul>
