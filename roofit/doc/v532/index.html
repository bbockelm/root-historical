<h4>AsymptoticCalculator</h4>
<ul>
<li>New Class for doing an hypothesis tests using the asymptotic likelihood formulae, described in the paper from
   G. Cowan, K. Cranmer, E. Gross and O. Vitells, <i>Asymptotic formulae for likelihood- based tests of new physics</i>,
   Eur. Phys. J., C71 (1), 2011.</li>
   <li> The class computes the p-value for the null and also for the alternate using the Asimov data set. In this
   differs form the ProfileLikelihoodCalculator which computes only the p-values for the null hypothesis.
   <li>The Asimov data set is generated with the utility function <tt>AsymptoticCalculator::MakeAsimovData</tt> and then
   it is used to evaluate the likelihood. 
   </li>
<li>This class implements the HypoTestCalculatorGeneric interface and can be used as an alternative Hypotesis test
   calculator in the HypoTestInverter class. It can then plugged in the HypoTestInverter for computing asymptotic CLs and CLs+b
   limits. In this way the limits will be computed by just performing a fit for each test parameter value and without
   generating any toys.  
</li>
<li>The class can be used via the <tt>StandardHypothesisTest.C</tt> tutorial passing a  value of <tt>2</tt> for the
calculator type. </li>
</ul>

<h4>RooStats Utils</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Add a utility function (from G. Petrucciani), <tt>RooStats::MakeNuisancePdf</tt>, which given a model configuration (or the global  pdf and the
  observables), factorizes from the model pdf the constraint probability density functions for the nuisance parameters
  and builds a global nuisance pdf. This function can then be used in the HybridCalculator or in the BayesianCalculator
  with the option "TOYMC".
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>HypotestInverter and HypoTestInverterResult</h4>
<ul>
<li> Several improvements and bug fixes in merging results and in computing the observed and expected limits.</li>
<li> Provide support now for using the AsympoticCalculator</li>
</ul>

<h4>MCMCCalculator</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Add now possibility to store in the chain only the parameter of interested via the method <tt> MCMCCalculator::SetChainParameters</tt>. This saves memory in case of models with a
  large number of nuisance parameters. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Test Statistics classes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Make a more robust evaluation of the ProfileLikelihoodTestStat. Use RooMinimizer and give possibility to use
  different minimizer, via <tt>ProfileLikelihoodTestStat::SetMinimizer</tt>. The print level of minimization can also be
  controlled via <tt>ProfileLikelihoodTestStat::SetPrintLevel</tt>. Activate also the RooFit cache optimizations when
  evaluating the NLL </li>
  <li>Fix a bug in reusing the NLL object in the SimpleLikelihoodCalculator. This makes now the evaluation of this test
  statistics much faster. </li>
 </ul>
