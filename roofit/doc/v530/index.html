<h3>HistFactory</h3>

One of the core classes used by HistFactory models (RooRealSumPdf) was modified leading to substantial speed improvements (for models that use the default -standard_form option).  

This new version supports a few types of interpolation for the normalization of the histograms:
<ul>
<li> code = 0: piece-wise linear (old default)</li>
<li> code = 1: piece-wise log (new default)</li>
<li> code = 2: parabolic interp with linear extrap ( common at tevatron, avoids kink for asymmetric uncert)</li>
</ul>
The piece-wise logarithmic interpolation paired with a Gaussian constraint is equivalent to a log-normal constraint in a transformed version of the nuisance parameter.  The benifit of this approach is that it is easy to avoid the normalization from taking on unphysical negative values.  This is the prescription used by the CMS Higgs group, and agreed upon by the LHC Higgs Combination Group.

There is not yet XML-based steering for the different interpolation types, but there is a simple script to modify it.

<h4>Near term goals for HistFactory</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Utilities for dealing with Monte Carlo statistical uncertainty in the template histograms</li>
  <li>Support for N-D histograms</li>
  <li>A new style of histogram variations without a constraint term attached (for shapes determined from control samples)</li>
  <li>XML steering for interpolation types</li>
</ul>

<h3>RooStats</h3>

<h4>General Improvements</h4>

This release brings several speed improvements to the RooStats tools and improved stability and performance with PROOF.  This comes mainly through changes to the <tt>ToyMCSampler</tt>.  In addition the <tt>HypoTestInverter</tt> tool has been rewritten, leading to some changes in the <tt>HypoTestResult</tt>.  Finally, a new hypothesis test new called <tt>FrequentistCalculator</tt> was written, which plays the same role as the <tt>HybridCalculator</tt> but eliminates nuisance parameters in a frequentist way.

<h4>ToyMCSampler</h4>

The primary interface for this class is to return a <tt>SamplingDistribution</tt> of a given <tt>TestStatistic</tt>.
The <tt>ToyMCSampler</tt> had a number of internal changes for improved performance with PROOF.  These should be transparent.  In addition, a new method was added <tt>RooAbsData* GenerateToyData(RooArgSet& paramPoint)</tt> that gives public access to the generation of toy data with all the same options for the treatment of nuisance parameters, binned or unbinned data, treatment of the global observables, importance sampling, etc.  This is new method particularly useful for producing the expected limit bands where one needs to generate background-only pseudo-experiments in the same way that was used for the primary limit calculation.

<h4>HypoTestResult</h4>

In the process of writing the new HypoTestInverter the conventions for p-values, CLb, CLs+b, and CLs were revisited.  The situation is complicated by the fact that when performing a hypothesis test for discovery the null is background-only, but when performing an inverted hypothesis test the null is a signal+background model.  The new convention is that the p-value for both the null and the alternate are taken from the same tail (as specified by the test statistic).  Both CLs+b and CLb are equivalent to these p-values, and the HypoTestResult has a simple switch <tt>SetBackgroundIsAlt()</tt> to specify the pairing between (null p-value, alternate p-value) and (CLb, CLs+b).

<h4>FrequentistCalculator</h4>
This is a <tt>HypoTestCalculator</tt> that returns a <tt>HypoTestResult</tt> similar to the <tt>HybridCalculator</tt>.  The primary difference is that this tool profiles the nuisance parameters for the null model and uses those fixed values of the nuisance parameters for generating the pseudo-experiments, where the <tt>HybridCalculator</tt> smears/randomizes/marginalizes the nuisance parameters.
