Installation Instructions for xrootd
====================================

These instructions refer to the GNU autotools build, not
to the build invoked by configure.classic.

Contents:

I) Basic compilation and installation
  Ia) Building from a tarball
  Ib) Building from CVS
II) Tested systems
III) How to use standard GNU autotools configure scripts
     (e.g how to obtain several different compilations
     with different options from the same sources)



I) Basic compilation and installation:
======================================

Ia) Building from a tarball

Building from a distribution tarball just involves the usual
configure, make, make install sequence:

./configure --prefix=install_directory [other options]
make
(make check)            builds test programs and runs tests
make install

Note: You don't need the autotools for building this package from
an official tarball. Only if changes in a Makefile.am template or
in the configure.ac files are made, autotools are required to
generate the updated configure script and the Makefiles.

If a build error is encountered on your system, please notify the
maintainers and include the config.log file that has been generated
in the top directory in your email.

if doxygen is available on your system, you can generate documentation
by executing

make doc


Configure options for subsystems:
---------------------------------

The --enable-FEATURE flags turn on building of an optional subsystem.
The location of libraries and header files needed for some of the
subsystems can be specified with the --with-FEATURE-libdir=PATH and
--with-FEATURE-incdir=PATH arguments.
Try "./configure --list for a list of options.

At the end of configure's run a summary of the enabled options is printed out,
including whether a feature was enabled by default, and what default files
were read (default files follow a simple syntax, so you can easily add your
own and e.g. source it with the --with-defaults=PATH option)

Results of configure's tests:
-----------------------------
You can look up what configure found (and what your original arguments were)
in the config.log file.
The generated config.status file is a shell script that will produce the exact 
same configuration as the one you just configured.




Ib) Building from CVS

Refer to section II) of the README.Maintainer file.





II) How to use standard GNU autotools configure scripts
=======================================================

- How to select the compiler

  by default configure will try to use the GNU compiler, if
  it can locate it on your system (except for Solaris). 
  You can specify a different compiler by setting the relevant
  variables on the configure line:

  ./configure CXXFLAGS="-g" CC=cc CXX=CC

  configure will test the compiler for its functionality and
  select the appropriate options.


- How to pass additional flags to the compiler/linker
  
  configure will honour settings in your environment. A list
  of the most important variables you get by running

  ./configure --help

  However, it is better to set the initial values for these
  variables from the configure line, e.g.

  ./configure --prefix="/opt/install" CFLAGS="-g" CXXFLAGS="-g"

  This line adds the -g flag for the C and C++ compilers.

  Note, that GNU make also allows you to pass values for these
  variables at build time using the same syntax:

  gmake CFLAGS="-g" CXXFLAGS="-g"

- How to make multiple builds with different options from the
  same sources (typically: optimized and debug builds):

  create a directory for every build. From inside this directory run
  the configure of the original source directory. The makefile
  structure will then be created under that directory.  This can also
  be used for having a number executables for different architectures
  which all refer to the same source directory.

- further information

  The most extensive information is found in the info pages for
  Automake and Autoconf on your system.
  The best book to understand and learn autotools is the autobook
  which can also be found online at
  http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/autobook/autobook_toc.html
