   * New application, cconfing, added to display configuration files relative to a host-program-instance.
   * New application, netchk, that tests that firewalls have been correctly setup.
   * New configure.classic option to allow use of stl4port library for Solaris.
   * New internal feature in XrdPosix library to not shadow files with actual file descriptors (used by the proxy
     service). This increases scalability.

   * Support fo proxies generated by Globus version 4.2.1 in libXrdSecssl.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Change link options for xrdadler32 to not use shared libraries. The previous setup caused the command to hang
     upon exit.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Fix XrdOucStream to not return ending "fi".
   * Correct network option interference -- do not turn on network nodnr option should the keepalive option
     be specified.
   * Remove duplicate option in option table used by the proxy service.
   * Compile on Solaris 11 Express using SunCC.
   * Compile on Windows using MSVC++2010.
