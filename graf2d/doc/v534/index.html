<h4>TPDF</h4>
<ul>
   <li>
      The table of content entries were not correct if there was and extra option
      before "Title:".
   </li>
   <li>
      After a title was once set, this title will be used for all following 
      additions to the PDF file, instead of "Page ###".
   </li>
   <li>
      Better sizes matching with the screen output for markers 6 and 7 (dots).
   </li>
</ul>

<h4>TLegend</h4>
<ul>
   <li>
      The option E, to draw the error bar on a legend entry, does not need 
      anymore the option L to be active. It is now possible to draw the error 
      bar only using the option E alone. The combination of the options E and L 
      still works as before.
   </li>
   <li>
      The text attributes were not properly initialized by the default 
      constructor.
   </li>
</ul>

<h4>TLatex</h4>
<ul>
   <li>
      Implement <tt>#mp</tt>.
   </li>
</ul>
