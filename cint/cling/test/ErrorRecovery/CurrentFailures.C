// The issue is that when we don't have semicolon in the end of the input
// in the case of cling where we have incremental compilation the parser 
// encounters an error and tries to recover by looking for so called safe tokens
// or anchors (e.g ';' or EOF). The input doesn't have semicolon and we play 
// with Lexer's EOF tokens. My assumption is that while trying to recover
// and continue parsing the Lexer enters sort-of error state and it breaks with // assertion
extern "C" int printf // expected-error {{expected ';' after top level declarator}}
