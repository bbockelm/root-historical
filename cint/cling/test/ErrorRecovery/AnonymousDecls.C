// Actually test clang::DeclContext::removeDecl(). This function in clang is 
// the main method that is used for the error recovery. This means when there 
// is an error in cling's input we need to revert all the declarations that came
// in from the same transaction. Even when we have anonymous declarations we 
// need to be able to remove them from the declaration context. In a compiler's
// point of view there is no way that one can call removeDecl() and pass in anon
// decl, because the method is used when shadowing decls, which must have names.
// The issue is (and we patched it) is that removeDecl is trying to remove the
// anon decl (which doesn't have name) from the symbol (lookup) tables, which 
// doesn't make sense.
// The current test checks if that codepath in removeDecl still exists because
// it is important for the stable error recovery in cling
