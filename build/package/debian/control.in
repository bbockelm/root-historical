Description: Meta-package to install all ROOT packages
 This package is a metapackage to ensure the installation of all
 possible ROOT packages on this system. 
 .
 The ROOT system provides a set of OO frameworks with all the
 functionality needed to handle and analyse large amounts of data in a
 very efficient way. Having the data defined as a set of objects,
 specialised storage methods are used to get direct access to the
 separate attributes of the selected objects, without having to touch
 the bulk of the data. Included are histograming methods in 1, 2 and 3
 dimensions, curve fitting, function evaluation, minimisation,
 graphics and visualisation classes to allow the easy setup of an
 analysis system that can query and process the data interactively or
 in batch mode.
 .
 Thanks to the built-in CINT C++ interpreter, the command language, the
 scripting, or macro, language, and the programming language are all
 C++. The interpreter allows for fast prototyping of the macros since
 it removes the time consuming compile/link cycle. It also provides a
 good environment to learn C++. If more performance is needed, the
 interactively developed macros can be compiled using a C++ compiler.
 .
 The system has been designed in such a way that it can query its
 databases in parallel on MPP machines or on clusters of workstations
 or high-end PC's. ROOT is an open system that can be dynamically
 extended by linking external libraries. This makes ROOT a premier
 platform on which to build data acquisition, simulation and data
 analysis systems.
