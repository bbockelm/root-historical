<h3>I/O</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add support for the Chirp filesystem.  To configure and build, chirp 3.2.2 must be installed.</li>

<li>When a <tt>TFile</tt> object is deleted, make sure that CINT also 'removes' any global variables that might point to it.</li>
<li>Fix support for the automatic addition to the current directory (for <tt>TTree</tt> and <tt>TH1</tt> for example) in <tt>TKey::Read(TObject*).</tt></li>
<li>In <tt>TKey</tt>, properly handle error in the I/O routines.</li>
<li>Explicitly check the validity of the zipped buffer before calling <tt>R__unzip</tt>, this allow for better error recovery.</li>
<li>When double checking whether a checksum difference is sustantial, ignore the std namespace.   Use <tt>CompareContent</tt> also in the case of where 
the class is versioned but the 'current' streamerInfo has not yet been built.</li>
<li>Prevent the I/O engine from mistakenly applying schema evolution to the <tt>TObject::fBits.</tt></li>
<li>Make sure that when a streamer info of a base class is used to stream memberwise that is always not-optimized. If the StreamerInfo on file 
has the same version as the StreamerInfo in memory but the one on file need to be 'not optimized' while the one in memory is not yet built, make 
sure it will not be optimized.</li>
<li>Fix the reading of empty collection of object when reading without the library.</li>
<li>If the sequence of actions for streaming member-wise is not created correctly (i.e. where <tt>fReadMemberWise</tt> was null previously),
we now explicitly issue a Fatal error:
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
Fatal in &lt;ReadSequence&gt;: The sequence of actions to read AliESDVertex:7 member-wise was not initialized.
aborting
</pre></li>
<li>Add new optional parameter maxbuf to <tt>TXMLEngine::ParseFile()</tt> allowing the specification of the XML file size to be parsed. This fixes issue <a href=https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?78864>#78864</a>.</li>
<li>Add function <tt>TBuffer::AutoExpand</tt> to centralize the automatic buffer extension policy.  This enable the ability to tweak it later (for example instead of always doubling the size, increasing by only at most 2Mb or take hints from the number of entries already
in a TBasket).</li>
<li>Migrate the class <tt>TFileMerger</tt> from the proofplayer library to ROOT I/O library and update <tt>hadd</tt> to rely on
 <tt>TFileMerger</tt> for everything but the command line argument parsing.</li>
<li>Fix support for schema evolution from:
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">   TParameter<Int_t>* MyInt; //-> version 1</pre>to
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">   TParameter<Int_t> MyInt; // version 2</pre>
</li>
<li>The TZIPFile compressed archive reader now supports the Zip64 format for
archives and file members greater than 2 and 4 GB, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MakeProject</h4>
 <ul>
 <li>Add support for the case when the requested project/files in path that in not under the current directory</li>
 <li>Generate the code/dictonary only for pair type that do not already have a dictionary</li>
</ul>
  
<h4>LZMA Compression and compression Level setting</h4>

ROOT I/O now support the LZMA compression algorithm to compress data in 
addition to the ZLIB compression algorithm.
LZMA compression typically results in smaller files, but takes more
CPU time to compress data. To use the new feature, the external XZ
package must be installed when ROOT is configured and built:

Download 5.0.3 from here <a href="http://tukaani.org/xz/">tukaani.org</a>
and make sure to configure with fPIC:
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">   ./configure CFLAGS='-fPIC'</pre>

Then the client C++ code must call routines to explicitly request LZMA
compression.<br/>
<p/>
ZLIB compression is still the default.

<h5>Setting the Compression Level and Algorithm</h5>

There are three equivalent ways to set the compression level and 
algorithm. For example, to set the compression to the LZMA algorithm
and compression level 5.
<ol><li><pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
TFile f(filename, option, title);
f.SetCompressionSettings(ROOT::CompressionSettings(ROOT::kLZMA, 5));
</pre></li>
<li>
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
TFile f(filename, option, title, ROOT::CompressionSettings(ROOT::kLZMA, 5));
</pre></li>
<li>
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
TFile f(filename, option, title);
f.SetCompressionAlgorithm(ROOT::kLZMA);
f.SetCompressionLevel(5);
</pre></li>
</ol>
These methods work for <tt>TFile</tt>, <tt>TBranch</tt>, <tt>TMessage</tt>, <tt>TSocket</tt>, and <tt>TBufferXML</tt>. 
The compression algorithm and level settings only affect compression of
data after they have been set. <tt>TFile</tt> passes its settings to a TTree's branches 
only at the time the branches are created. This can be overidden by 
explicitly setting the level and algorithm for the branch. These classes 
also have the following methods to access the algorithm and level for 
compression.
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
Int_t GetCompressionAlgorithm() const;
Int_t GetCompressionLevel() const;
Int_t GetCompressionSettings() const;
</pre>
If the compression level is set to 0, then no compression will be
done. All of the currently supported algorithms allow the level to be
set to any value from 1 to 9. The higher the level, the larger the
compression factors will be (smaller compressed data size). The
tradeoff is that for higher levels more CPU time is used for
compression and possibly more memory. The ZLIB algorithm takes less
CPU time during compression than the LZMA algorithm, but the LZMA
algorithm usually delivers higher compression factors.
<p/>
The header file core/zip/inc/Compression.h declares the function
"CompressionSettings" and the enumeration for the algorithms.
Currently the following selections can be made for the algorithm:
kZLIB (1), kLZMA (2), kOldCompressionAlgo (3), and kUseGlobalSetting
(0). The last option refers to an older interface used to control the
algorithm that is maintained for backward compatibility. The following
function is defined in core/zip/inc/Bits.h and it set the global
variable.
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
R__SetZipMode(int algorithm);
</pre>
If the algorithm is set to kUseGlobalSetting (0), the global variable
controls the algorithm for compression operations.  This is the
default and the default value for the global variable is kZLIB.

<h4>Asynchronous Prefetching</h4>
The prefetching mechanism uses two new classes (<tt>TFilePrefetch</tt> 
and <tt>TFPBlock</tt>) to prefetch in advance a block of tree entries. There
is a thread which takes care of actually transferring the blocks and
making them available to the main requesting thread. Therefore, the time
spent by the main thread waiting for the data before processing considerably
decreases. Besides the prefetching mechanisms there is also a local
caching option which can be enabled by the user. Both capabilities are
disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled by the user. 
</p>
In order to enable the prefetching the user must set the rootrc environment
variable <tt>TFile.AsyncPrefetching</tt> as follows: 
<tt>gEnv->SetValue("TFile.AsyncPrefetching", 1)</tt>. Only when the
prefetching is enabled can the user set the local cache directory in
which the file transferred will be saved. For subsequent reads of the
same file the system will use the local copy of the file from cache.
To set up a local cache directory, the client can use the following commands:

<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
TString cachedir="file:/tmp/xcache/";
// or using xrootd on port 2000  
// TString cachedir="root://localhost:2000//tmp/xrdcache1/";
gEnv->SetValue("Cache.Directory", cachedir.Data());
</pre>

The <tt>TFilePrefetch</tt> class is responsible for actually reading
and storing the requests received from the main thread. It also creates
the working thread which will transfer all the information. Apart from
managing the block requests, it also deals with caching the blocks on
the local machine and retrieving them when necessary. 
</p>
The <tt>TFPBlock</tt> class represents the encapsulation of a block
request. It contains the chunks to be prefetched and also serves as a
container for the information read.
