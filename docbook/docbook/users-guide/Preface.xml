<title>Preface</title>
<para>Draft, November 2000 - version 0.6.2In late 1994, we decided to learn and
investigate Object Oriented programming and C++ to better judge the suitability
of these relatively new techniques for scientific programming. We knew that
there is no better way to learn a new programming environment than to use it to
write a program that can solve a real problem. After a few weeks, we had our
first histogramming package in C++. A few weeks later we had a rewrite of the
same package using the, at that time, very new template features of C++. Again,
a few weeks later we had another rewrite of the package without templates since
we could only compile the version with templates on one single platform using a
specific compiler. Finally, after about four months we had a histogramming
package that was faster and more efficient than the well-known FORTRAN based
HBOOK histogramming package. This gave us enough confidence in the new
technologies to decide to continue the development. Thus was born ROOT. Since
its first public release at the end of 1995, ROOT has enjoyed an ever-increasing
popularity. Currently it is being used in all major High Energy and Nuclear
Physics laboratories around the world to monitor, to store and to analyze data.
In the other sciences as well as the medical and financial industries, many
people are using ROOT. We estimate the current user base to be around several
thousand people. In 1997, Eric Raymond analyzed in his paper "The Cathedral and
the Bazaar" the development method that makes Linux such a success. The essence
of that method is: "release early, release often and listen to your customers".
This is precisely how ROOT is being developed. Over the last five years, many of
our "customers" became co-developers. Here we would like to thank our main
co-developers and contributors:</para>
<para>
<emphasis role="bold">Masaharu Goto</emphasis> wrote the CINT C++ interpreter
that became an essential part of ROOT. Despite being 8 time zones ahead of us,
we have the feeling he has been sitting in the room next door since 1995.
</para>
<para>
<emphasis role="bold">Andrei</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Mihaela
Gheata</emphasis> (Alice collaboration) are co-authors of the ROOT geometry
classes and Virtual Monte-Carlo. They have been working with the ROOT team since
2000.

developers of the PROOF sub-system (since 1995).
</para>
<para>

and contributed largely to the 3-D graphics. He is currently working on the Qt
layer of ROOT (since 1995).
</para>
