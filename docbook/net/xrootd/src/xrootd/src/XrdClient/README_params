Here is the list of the internal parameters of XrdClient, with their meaning.
The parameters names are case sensitive.


Name: ConnectTimeout
Default value: 60
Desc: The timeout value for connection attempts at the init of an instance.
 Any timeout will be internally treated as a recoverable error, and handled
 in some way, typically retrying. Note that a connection attempt may
 fail before this time.

Name: RequestTimeout
Default value: 60
Desc: The timeout value for send/receive attempts. Any timeout
 will be internally treated as a recoverable error, and handled
 in some way, typically auto-redirecting to the first redirector encountered.

Name: MaxRedirectcount
Default value: 255
Desc: If a client gets redirected or auto-redirected more times than this
 number in the last RedirCntTimeout seconds, the pending operation will be abandoned.

Name: RedirCntTimeout
Default value: 3600
Desc: see up.

Name: DebugLevel
Default value: 0
Desc: Verbosity of the printed output.
 -1 = no printing at all
 0 = print only errors, and a few more.
 1 = really basic trace of what's happening
 2 = trace of what is the client doing
 3 = Ultra-verbose: dump every data exchange
 4 = Hyper-verbose: dump everything flowing through sockets

Name: ReconnectTimeout
Default value: 10
Desc: The timeout value for re-connection attempts. Any timeout
 will be internally treated as a recoverable error, and handled
 in some way, typically retrying. Note that a connection attempt may
 fail before this time.


Name: FirstConnectMaxCnt
Default value: 150
Desc: How many times the connection on initialization will be retried,
 in the case of error.

Name: StartGarbageCollectorThread
Default value: 1
Desc: A really paranoid parameter. If set to 0, the physical/logical
 connections are no more closed if inactive.

Name: GoAsync
Default value: 1
Desc: Choose between the sync/async internal architecture. The sync one
 is unable to handle unsolicited responses, and will never be.

Name: ReadCacheSize
Default value: 4000000
Desc: The max size of the read cache. One cache per instance. Set to 0 to
 disable caching.

Name: ReadAheadSize
Default value: 800000
Desc: The size of the blocks requested and populating the cache.

Name: RedirDomainAllowRE
Default value: Internally computed to allow only operations
 on the local domain.
Desc: Given a list of |-separated regexps for the domains to ALLOW REDIR to, 
 match every entry with domain. If NO match is found, deny access. Only * is
 allowed in the regexps, and only at the beginning or the end of the single exprs

Name: RedirDomainDenyRE
Default value: Internally computed to allow only operations
 on the local domain.
Desc: Given a list of |-separated regexps for the domains to DENY REDIR to,

 allowed in the regexps, and only at the beginning or the end of the single exprs

Name: ConnectDomainAllowRE
Default value: Internally computed to allow only operations
 on the local domain.
Desc: Given a list of |-separated regexps for the domains to ALLOW CONNECT to, 
 match every entry with domain. If NO match is found, deny access. Only * is

Name: ConnectDomainDenyRE
Default value: Internally computed to allow only operations
 on the local domain.
Desc: Given a list of |-separated regexps for the domains to DENY CONNECT to, 
 match every entry with domain. If ANY match is found, deny access. Only * is
 allowed in the regexps, and only at the beginning or the end of the single exprs
